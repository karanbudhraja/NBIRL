Testing the cvx distribution. If this script aborts with
an error, please report the error to the authors.
-------------------------------------------------------------
No errors! cvx has been successfully installed.
 
NOTE: The MATLAB path has been updated to point to the cvx distribution.
In order to use cvx regularly, you must save this new path definition.
To accomplish this, add these lines to your startup.m file:
    addpath /home/karanb1/workspaces/matlab/irl_toolkit_original_manualmdp/Utilities/cvx
    addpath /home/karanb1/workspaces/matlab/irl_toolkit_original_manualmdp/Utilities/cvx/structures
    addpath /home/karanb1/workspaces/matlab/irl_toolkit_original_manualmdp/Utilities/cvx/lib
    addpath /home/karanb1/workspaces/matlab/irl_toolkit_original_manualmdp/Utilities/cvx/functions
    addpath /home/karanb1/workspaces/matlab/irl_toolkit_original_manualmdp/Utilities/cvx/commands
    addpath /home/karanb1/workspaces/matlab/irl_toolkit_original_manualmdp/Utilities/cvx/builtins
Consult the MATLAB documentation if necessary.
